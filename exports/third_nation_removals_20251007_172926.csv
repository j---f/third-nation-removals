A DHS official told me “some” had criminal records, but this cannot be independently verified, and the official is known to have lied before about migrants’ criminal backgrounds. Later September, up to 14 more migrants from Nigeria, Liberia, Togo and perhaps Mali, who also appear to have been asylum-seekers. At least two said they were green card holders who had completed prison sentences for fraud."

At least three had been released into the community without incident before being detained by ICE and sent to Eswatini. DHS claimed their countries had refused to take them back, but attorneys for the men, and at least one of the countries, deny this. In October, a second group of no more than 11 third-country nationals arrived and were imprisoned."
SOUTH SUDAN,2025-10-07,,,Various,,"Who: Seven men originally from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam. (An eighth man removed with this group is from South Sudan.) DHS said the men had been convicted of serious crimes in the US, had completed their sentences, and that their countries of origin had refused to accept their return.

BHUTAN,2025-10-07,,27,Various,,"Who: At least 27 stateless refugees stripped of citizenship by Bhutan in the 1990s due to their ethnicity who legally resettled in the US.
